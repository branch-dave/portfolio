       <h2>Co-Pilot</h2>

			<p>
        I led the design of FOX TV’s Internal tool Co-Pilot over a two week sprint in March 2015. I was responsible for the user experience across the entire platform from concept to development.
      </p>
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p><i>&quot;Improve an existing legacy application used by FOX TV’s Programming Execs and turn it into a modern, fully functioning web application.&quot;</i></p>
      <p>Co-Pilot is an internal tool used by FOX TV and its associates to track performance and scheduling for all of its home-grown TV series. It had outgrown its initial use case when we started development, and it was an aging .NET application with a poor User Experience. </p>
      <p>An initial redesign by a previous designer hadn’t gone down well with stakeholders and I was asked to complete a design sprint in two weeks to recreate the initial architecture used by the designer and turn the app into something more beautiful and usable.</p>
      <h3>The Approach</h3>
      <p>With the initial Information architecture already in place and a user flow that all stakeholders agreed upon, I set about redesigning the layout and concept of Co-Pilot. Using an iPad as my base device - the company had issued one to each stakeholder - I had a week to turn in a revised design for approval and then started refining the designs, as well as creating a mobile-friendly layout for stakeholders to use on the go.</p>

      <h3>The Product</h3>
      <h4>Hello, Co-Pilot</h4>
      <p>Co-Pilot is a place for everyone involved at FOX TV to come and learn about the traction, outcomes and targets set for its programming.</p>
      <h4>Architecture</h4>
      <p>The first problem I found with Co-Pilot is that their programming page was far too complex. By switching to a tabbed layout I made sure that all of the information was only a click or two away. From casting details to social buzz and script updates, each of these sections was quickly accessible.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="content">
     <h4>Navigation</h4>
     <p>Another problem I came across was that FOX TV’s wealth of TV programming output has rendered a list of shows almost pointless. With stakeholders used to searching for their material, they requested a search functionality rather than an indexed version of all their programming. This de-cluttered the interface and meant that we could showcase new programming to stakeholders on the main page of the site.</p>
     <h3>The Impact</h3>
     <p> Although my time on Co-Pilot was short I believe the impact I made on this project met all of the stakeholders needs. They were immensely happy with the application I re-designed for them - so much so, I was asked to collaborate again on another exciting internal project for <a href="/work/national-geographic">National Geographic.</a></p>
