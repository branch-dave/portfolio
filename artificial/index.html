       <h1>UX Critique: Maison Sport</h1>
			<p>
        <strong>Task:</strong> Create a critique of Maison Sport - a new platform being built by Artificial Labs.</p>
      <h4>Initial Thoughts</h4>
      <p>My first thoughts are that the site looks beautiful, is well presented and the IA is top notch. The suggestions I will make won't have a huge impact on the IA of the site and may not be correct without further studies or A/B testing.</p>
      <p>I will mainly focus on driving conversions on the site, as well as making the site slightly more mobile-friendly.</p>
      <h4>Booking Form</h4>
      <p>One of the first things I saw on the page was this booking form, I believe small improvements can be made to help the overall experience of using this form.</p>

      <h4>Travel Dates</h4>
        <p>Studies have shown that a single input control for travel dates works better than multiple inputs, <strong>especially on mobile.</strong></li>
          <br />

        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Create a single input for your date picker, design it so that it's immediately obvious you are booking two dates. This decreases the amount of clicks neccesary to complete the action, and should hopefully improve conversion.</p>
          <p> This type of date picker could be particularly useful as snowsports trips are expensive, the amount of people booking instruction would typically be a relatively short amount of time.</p>

        <h4>Instructor</h4>
        <p>Similarly, a dropdown menu for choosing an instructor increases the amount of clicks to complete the form, it's also not immediately obvious what i'm choosing from the Placeholder text.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Create checkboxes and open up the information onto the page, make the text more actionable (e.g Choose an Instructor) to ensure that it's more obvious to the user what the outcome will be.</p>
        <br>

              <br>
        <h4>Prototype</h4>
        <p>I've decided to go for a mobile first approach and built a prototype of the calendar and instructor checkboxes for a small viewport, these changes could be easily implemented into the desktop design as well.</p>
        <br />

        </ul>
        <br>
      <hr>
        <h4>Breakdown</h4>
        <p>I wanted to give a clearer overview of why I made certain design decisions, you can see from the images below the thought process behind this prototype:</p>

     <h4>Conclusion</h4>
     <p>These kind of changes are particularly important when considering how much work it is to fill in a form on mobile, the small gains you make can have big impact on the amount of time spent on something as undesirable as form filling.</p>
     <p>I wanted to base my critique on data and information rather than assumptions and I hope you can see a glimpse into my thought process and the sources that I use also.</p>
     <p>Finally, I'd like to highlight an important discussion, something that Luke Wroblewski touches on in his article and these guys take to new heights.</p>

     <small>Highly recommend you put this on in the lab. Fair warning: LOTS of profanity</small>
