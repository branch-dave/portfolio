    <h1>Iâ€™m Dave Hawkins, a UK based designer.</h1>
    <p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.placeavote.com">Placeavote</a>, but I also teach User Experience Design part time at <a href="https://www.springboard.com/">Springboard.</a><br /></p>
    <p>I've delivered digital products for companies like National Geographic, FOX TV, as well as startups and established technology companies. I love seeing companies I work with get real traction through the products I've helped build for them, and I want to know if you've got real problems that need solving.
